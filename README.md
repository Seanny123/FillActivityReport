Instructions
=============

1. Make a copy of `fill_it.js` onto your computer.
2. Fill out `fill_it.js` with your information. The first field is `f_name` and the last field is `comments`.
2. Navigate the Activity Report SYDE page.
3. Copy *all* of the contents of `fill_it.js` into [the web-browser console](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/66420/how-do-you-launch-the-javascript-debugger-in-google-chrome) and run the code.

This was only tested on the MaSc form with Google Chrome. Hypothetically, this should be made a
bookmarklet and have a friendlier interface than directly editing JavaScript code, but I'm not that good at JavaScript.
