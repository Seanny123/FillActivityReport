Instructions
=============

1. Fill out `fill_it.js` with your information.
2. Navigate the Activity Report SYDE page.
3. Copy `fill_it.js` into [the web-browser console](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/66420/how-do-you-launch-the-javascript-debugger-in-google-chrome) and run the code.

This was only tested on the MaSc form with Google Chrome. Hypothetically this should be made a
bookmarklet, but I'm not that good at JavaScript.
